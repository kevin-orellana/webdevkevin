				Growing demand for cloud-based technology services continued to drive employment gains last month in the U.S. information-technology sector, offsetting declines in telecommunications, data processing, hosting and related services, according to IT trade group CompTIA.

				The U.S. IT sector added a total of 10,300 new jobs last month, up from 9,600 in July, led by gains in IT and software services, as well as an upswing in demand for computer manufacturers, CompTIA says.

				Employers providing IT and software services added 8,000 new jobs, while computer, electronics and semiconductor manufacturing firms added 3,900, more than double the rate from the prior month.

				The results are based on an analysis of the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data, released Friday.

				Across the economy, nonfarm payrolls rose 156,000 in August, ​a slowdown from the past two months, pushing the unemployment rate up ​to 4.4%, from a 16-year low, the Labor Department reported.

				By contrast, the unemployment rate for IT jobs stood at 2.5% last month, according to CompTIA.

				“IT services have powered tech sector job growth all year,” Tim Herbert, the group’s senior vice president of research and market intelligence, said in a statement. That upward trend is likely to continue, he said, adding that the question is whether gains in IT and software services “will offset losses in telecom to achieve projected net job growth on the year.”

				Telecommunications firms shed 2,700 jobs last month, compared to a loss of 100 jobs in July.

				Demand for IT workers outside of the tech sector also saw gains last month, increasing by 101,000 new jobs, following declines in July, CompTIA reported.

				Job postings for IT project managers rose by 1,300 from the prior month. Fewer employers were looking for software developers, computer systems engineers and computer systems analysts, CompTIA said.
