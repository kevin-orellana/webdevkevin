The article offers advice on the important of good planning in web development. 
It offers tips for a web development project manager throughout the various stages of a site's development process. 
Some of these tips are meant to save time but others are more fundamental, such as understanding the purpose of the site hollistically.

The article also highlights the importance of understanding the job's in the site's production process. Such mindfulness may reduce unnecessary
overhead costs. For example, while a graphic designer may require high fidelity mock ups, a back-end web developer may only require a general
notion of the site's layout.
